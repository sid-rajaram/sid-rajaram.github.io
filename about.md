This is my site where I document (non-work) projects, things I've recently learned, and anything else I find interesting. I studied auditory attention during my PhD in computational neuroscience, and work as a machine learning scientist/engineer ([LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidrajaram/)).

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses the base Jekyll theme, [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). I can be contacted at *admin - at - this domain*.
